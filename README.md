# Machine Learning with Python 

Python implementation of ML classifiers for ham/spam text classification.

## Motivation

This repository was created to gain a better understanding of the existing Machine Learning algorithms and the foundational concepts behind those. This project implements machine learning algorithms presented in the [Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn Book](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2022/ml-pytorch-book.html) for the ham/spam classification problem.

The project use a Spam/Ham dataset foudn on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bagavathypriya/spam-ham-dataset), manually selected features were extracted from messages using [spacy](https://spacy.io/).
