# Machine Learning with Python 

Repository of ML classifiers to familiarize myself with this domain. Use the ham-spam classification task. 

## Motivation 

I want to familiarize myself with machine learning methods, first by reading about them but also through implementation. Ham-spam classification is interesting because small datasets already exists, and Natural Language Processing techniques can be applied on them (which are very trendy). The dataset comes from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bagavathypriya/spam-ham-dataset?resource=download&select=spamhamdata.csv.
